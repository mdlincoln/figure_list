# list_figures

Utility for generating a LaTeX figure list from a YAML source file using Pandoc.
I wrote this to ease the formatting of figures for academic papers, specifically art history papers that require consistently-formatted captions.
Since I use a [rakefile to call Pandoc](http://lincolnmullen.com/blog/rake-and-pandoc/) anyway, I use this gem like a pre-processor before passing the completed markdown file into Pandoc.
